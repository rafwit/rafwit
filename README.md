Full-Stack Developer 🤖
Currently a member of an agile squad 🧕🦸🏿‍♀️🤖👨🏼‍🔬👨🏻‍🚀🕵🏿‍♂️👩🏾‍🎓👩🏻‍💻👩🏽‍🎨 where I'm mainly focused on building reliable and heavily tested microservices in Node.js
and creating a great developer experience by contributing to internal APIs documentation using React.

If not coding, you can find me hiking 🏔 or playing Ultimate Frisbee 🥏 in Catalonia. Hopefully soon around the 🌍
